# Time Keeper

This is an app written in React and Node with Express that will help
you track time for projects. It uses a local file to read and write to.

I use it to track time on free-lance projects.

### Running the app

1. Ensure you have `npm` installed.

Follow the instructions for your platform [here](https://github.com/npm/npm).

2. Install all dependencies:

````
npm install
````

3. Boot the HTTP server

````
npm run server
````

The server is now running at [localhost:3000](localhost:3000)
