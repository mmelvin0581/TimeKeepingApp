# Time Keeper

This is an app written in React and Node with Express that will help you track time for projects. It reads/write from/to
a local file. If you shut the server down or close the browser window your time will still be tracked!

I use it to track time on free-lance projects.

## Running the app

1. Ensure you have `npm` installed.

Follow the instructions for your platform [here](https://github.com/npm/npm).

2. Install all dependencies:

````
npm install
or
yarn install
````

3. Boot the HTTP server

````
npm start
or
yarn start
````

The server is now running at [localhost:3000](localhost:3000)

### Helpful Information
You can shut down the server and your timers will still track the time! This means you only have to have the app open to
start and/or stop servers.
